# CS5525 Project2 - Getting Started

Open terminal on your machine, type in:

`ssh -L 8000:localhost:xxxx username@rlogin.cs.vt.edu`

Replace "xxxx" with an arbitrary 4 digits number, for example 8765. We will use this number later, let's use xxxx to denote it.
Replace "username" with your vt id, for example "kklein".
After login,execute the following command line by line:
	
```
mkdir COVID_clustering
cd COVID_clustering
python3 -m venv python3-virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install jupyter --user
python3 -m pip install pandas sklearn searborn numpy bokeh --user
jupyter lab --port xxxx 
```

You may get some messages like:
```
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///C:/Users/bujie/AppData/Roaming/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-9476-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:xxxx/?token=c3c6074b04bff28d83fdc5d0ede431c0a121774816db49b2
     or http://127.0.0.1:xxxx/?token=c3c6074b04bff28d83fdc5d0ede431c0a121774816db49b2
```

It shows your jupyter server is running at port xxxx and your token will be the string after "token=". The xxxx value should be the same as the number you pick. Otherwise, you may need to pick another value for xxxx and login again.Follow the following:

- Close the terminal and open a new one.
- Use a new value of xxxx, type in:

`ssh -L 8000:localhost:xxxx username@rlogin.cs.vt.edu`

- After login,execute the following commands line by line:
	
```
cd COVID_clustering
source venv/bin/activate
jupyter lab --port xxxx 
```

Note that the above three lines are the code you need to execute each time you login into the remote machine.On your PC, open `http://localhost:xxxx` in a browser.For the first time login, you may be asked to provide token to create a password.
You may be able to see the UI of Jupyter Lab. By default, it has a side bar with file explorer at left and a notebook editor at right.
You should be able to upload the notebook "covid-19-literature-clustering.ipynb" by draggin it into the file explorer in the Jupyter Lab UI.
Double click to open it in the notebook editor.Download the dataset into your machine from Google Drive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IC0s9QoBLWFN9tRI-z2QbJJWgngfAm8w/viewDrag the downloaded "CORD-19-research-challenge.zip" into the file explorer in your Jupyter Lab UI. It will start uploading the file into the remote server. It might take a while and please make sure you have stable network connection.Click on the "+" button on top of the file explorer and choose terminal in the popped out tab. Then type in the following:
	
```
cd COVID_clustering
unzip CORD-19-research-challenge.zip
```
Finally, you should be able to run your notebook.
